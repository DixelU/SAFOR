# SAFOR
**Simple AF Overlaps Remover**

A console application which allows to create midis without any note *doubling* or *overlaping* with keeping the same visuals as in original midi.
Sadly it *does* load file in memory, but every new event goes through some filtering therfore allowing to keep only *important* notes.

Appreciate issue reporting :)
